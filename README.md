# Predicting-Heart-Attacks-Using-Machine-Learning

Models Used

The following machine learning models were implemented and evaluated:
Random Forest
Logistic Regression
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Gradient Boosting

Performance Summary

Algorithm ||  Training Accuracy || Validation Accuracy ||
Random Forest || 1.000 || 0.9859
Logistic Regression || 0.7952 || 0.7995
KNN || 0.7356 || 0.6478
Gradient Boosting || 0.9989 || 0.9859


Dataset

The dataset consists of clinical and demographic features, such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other cardiovascular indicators. Proper preprocessing techniques, including normalization and feature selection, were applied to improve model performance.

Future Improvements

To enhance the predictive capability of the model, the following improvements are planned:
Enhance feature engineering to better capture important patterns
Experiment with ensemble models to combine strengths of different algorithms
Fine-tune hyperparameters for optimal performance
Expand dataset to improve generalization
